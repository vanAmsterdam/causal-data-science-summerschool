## Today's lectures

## Causal inference frameworks

### What are they for?

## Causal inference frameworks

### Why learn more than one?

## Lecture 1 & 2 topics

# Motivating examples

## Example task: are hospital deliveries good for babies?

## Observed data

## New question: hernia

## Observed data 2

## How to unravel this?

## Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs

### diagram that represents our assumptions on causal relations

## Making DAGs for our examples:

### The pregnancy DAG

## Making DAGs for our examples:

### The hernia DAG

## Causal DAGs to the rescue

# Some math background: probabilites and assumptions

## Why math???

## Marginal, Joint and Conditional probabilites

## conditional probabilities require dividing by the denominator of the conditioning set

## Probability rules and identities

## Marginal and conditional independence:

## Conditional Independence in an example

## Assumption parlance (strong vs weak assumption, necessary, sufficient)

# DAG definitions

## DAGs convey two types of assumptions:

### causal direction and conditional independence

## DAGs are 'non-parametric'

### They relay what variable 'listens' to what, but not in what way

## DAGs imply a causal factorization of the joint distribution

## The DAG definition of an intervention {#sec-def-intervention}

## Intervention as graph surgery - changed distribution

## Back to example 1

## Back to example 2

## The gist of observational causal inference

# DAG rules

## Basic DAG patterns: chain

## Basic DAG patterns: fork

## Basic DAG patterns: collider

## Collider bias - Tinder

## Conditioning on a collider creates dependence of its parents

## When life gets complicated / real: many variable

## d-separation (directional-separation)

## d-separation when conditioning

## The back-door criterion and adjustment

## Did we see this equation before?

## How about positivity
