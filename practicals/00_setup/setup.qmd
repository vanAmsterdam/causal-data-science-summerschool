We will work with R.
You can use your preferred way of working in R to do the practicals. Our preferred way is this:

- Create a new folder with a good name, e.g., `practicals_causal_datascience` 
- Open RStudio
- Create a new project from RStudio, which you associate with the folder
- Create a `raw_data` subfolder
- Create an R script for the current practical, e.g., `introduction.R`
- Create your well-documented and [well-styled](https://style.tidyverse.org/) code in this R script

We try to make our practicals light in the number of required packages, but the packages below are needed.
You can install them via:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: false

needed_packages <- c(
  "data.table", "broom", "purrr", "dagitty", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "marginaleffects"
)
cran_repo <- "https://mirror.lyrahosting.com/CRAN/" # <- a CRAN mirror in the Netherlands, can select another one from here https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

for (pkg in needed_packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, repos=cran_repo)
  }
}
```
