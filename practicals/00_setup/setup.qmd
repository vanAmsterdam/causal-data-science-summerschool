We will work with R.
You can use your preferred way of working in R to do the practicals. Our preferred way is this:

- Create a new folder with a good name, e.g., `practicals_causal_datascience` 
- Open RStudio
- Create a new project from RStudio, which you associate with the folder
- Create a `raw_data` subfolder
- Create an R script for the current practical, e.g., `introduction.R`
- Create your well-documented and [well-styled](https://style.tidyverse.org/) code in this R script

We try to make our practicals light in the number of required packages, but these are needed:

You can install them via ...

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("data.table"))
```
