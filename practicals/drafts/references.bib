	abstract = {The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind.Emerson (1860)PrefaceIn the previous chapter we dealt with ways of learning causal relationships from raw data. In this chapter we explore the ways of inferring such relationships from a combination of data and qualitative causal assumptions that are deemed plausible in a given domain. More broadly, this chapter aims to help researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about cause–effect relationships, elucidate the ramifications of such assumptions, and derive causal inferences from a combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. Our major task will be to decide whether the assumptions given are sufficient for assessing the strength of causal effects from nonexperimental data.Causal effects permit us to predict how systems would respond to hypothetical interventions – for example, policy decisions or actions performed in everyday activity. As we have seen in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3), such predictions are the hallmark of the empirical sciences and are not discernible from probabilistic information alone; they rest on – and, in fact, define – causal relationships. This chapter uses causal diagrams to give formal semantics to the notion of intervention, and it provides explicit formulas for postintervention probabilities in terms of preintervention probabilities. The implication is that the effects of every intervention can be estimated from nonexperimental data, provided the data is supplemented with a causal diagram that is both acyclic and contains no latent variables.},
