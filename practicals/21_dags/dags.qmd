In this practical, ...


::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon=true}
The answers to each exercise are available as a collapsed `code` block. Try to work out the answer yourself before looking at this code block!
:::

First we load a package

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: true

library(survival)
```

In this practical, we will also use the following two packages:

::: {.callout-note}
## Exercise 1
Grab a coffee
:::


::: {.callout-note}
## Exercise 2
Load the `mtcars` dataset in R 

```{r}
#| label: data-true
#| eval: true

data(mtcars)
```

## Non-coding questions

### Strength of Assumptions

::: {#fig-3dags layout-ncol=3}

![DAG](_tikzs/daga.png){#fig-daga}

![DAG](_tikzs/dagb.png){#fig-dagb}

![DAG](_tikzs/dagc.png){#fig-dagc}

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## What is the correct ordering of strength of assumptions in the above DAGs, starting with the strongest assumption

answer: @fig-dagb > @fig-dagc > @fig-daga

@fig-dagb is stronger than @fig-dagc as in the latter, it could be that the effects through $W$ are all absent (remember that the presence of an arrow from A to B implies a **possible** effect of A on B)

@fig-dagc is stronger than @fig-daga as in the first, Z can **only** affect Y through T and W, whereas in @fig-daga Z *can* effect Y through T and *can* effect Y through other paths (e.g. W)
